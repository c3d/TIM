# Theory of Incomplete Measurements

The [_theory of incomplete measurements_][blog] purports to unify general
relativity and quantum mechanics by offering a purely discrete (non-continuous)
description of the universe. It focuses on measurements seen as the only reality
for the physicists, and highlight how much measurments diverge from abstract
mathematics.  This theory is based on an _extended principle of relativity_
stating that physicists should be able to describe the laws of the universe
using any measurement instrument.
